# Some boring GitHub stuff:

I have set of repositories here. Some were even forked by other users (most of time without contributing back).

Touched countless repos. I often contribute to projects just to vanish once it gets merged (so called [drive-by coding](https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2020/09/16/from-a-diary-of-aarch64-porter-drive-by-coding/)).
